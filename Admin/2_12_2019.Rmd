    + normalizations
* Where to mount the data
  + Rstudio server?

# ACTION ITEMS

* Feature selection: Look at sample to see which variables are important
  + Building new variables
  + Writing exploration code so that we can plug in future data and get graphs etc.
* Everyone: Look at sample projects on Piazza
* Simeon: Look for shapefile to add neighborhood/census block
* George: Create 1% sample 
* Shiv: Define exact problem we are solving
* Trace: Naive model to predict price based on other vars (track how closely this corresponds to NYC taxi fare rules)
